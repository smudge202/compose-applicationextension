#Compose.ApplicationExtension

This package simple drops boiler plate code into your project and brings in the necessary dependencies so you can quickly get started defining your Application Extension.

We keep this project up to date with the latest _stable_ development at [Microsoft.Framework.DependencyInjection] and [Compose] so you can pick up and go.

This package directly depends upon [Compose] to allow you to create Extension Methods for Executables and Applications.
